# Elite Dangerous Log Print

This app is an assistant what prints events from the game in a console window on a second monitor. Surface scanning events print complete information about the scanned body, which is helpful for exploration.

It also automatically renames screenshots from the game according to the scheme:
`<bodyname>_(coordinates on surface if available)_<datetime>.bmp`

When developing this application, some ideas were used from applications such as [EDMarketConnector](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector) and [EliteObservatory](https://github.com/Xjph/EliteObservatory).

## Requirements

Windows only
